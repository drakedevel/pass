See the output of `$ pass.py --help` for detailed usage information.

words.txt is generated from the Google 1-gram dataset. Most of the
1-grams which were found in /usr/share/dict words and matched
/^[a-z]{3,8}$/ and were recorded in descending order of frequency.

Two modes of password generation are provided, random and
controlled. In random mode, words are selected at random from the top
N words in words.txt. In controlled mode, words are selected from the
top N words in words.txt such that no two words come from the same
"batch" of words -- i.e. it is impossible to to select the three most
common English words with any reasonable N.

Random mode provides slightly higher entropy (a few bits) but you may
end up with a password that can be cracked by an attacker using a
lower N (i.e., your password may be substantially earlier in a
brute-force search). Controlled mode eliminates this possibility at
the expense of a small amount of total entropy, and is a reasonable
default choice.
